# Notepad
I created a Notepad application using Java, incorporating AWT and Swing for the UI coding.

Notepad is designed to be a lightweight and simple text editor. It provides essential features like creating, opening, and saving text files. You can also find basic editing functionalities, such as copy, cut, paste, undo, and redo. Notepad supports searching for specific words or phrases within a document.
